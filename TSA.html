            </section>
            We are Chapter 2111, and we currently have about twenty members. Our chapter has been slowly
            growing over the years, and we have members competing in various events this year. We believe
            in working hard and doing our best to achieve our goals, even if some might look down on our efforts,
            because we know that the process of learning is far more valuable than the reward itself. Click here to

              Our History
            </section>
            Mckinney Boyd's Computer Science Club was founded in 2015 by Thai Nguyen and Sammy Shin, who sought to help others learn how to program. The Engineering Club
            has been a part of student life at Boyd since 2010, and they worked together with
            both TSA and the Living Roof. Now, the clubs joined to help everyone work
            on their TSA projects, meet new people they can partner with, and just see other available options
            they can try next time.</section></td>

              Community Service Projects
            </section>
            We volunteer at Hour of Code events in schools within our community. This is an oppportunity where we provide
            lessons to those interested in computer science who don't have the resources to get started. We also
            volunteer in the Eddins Elementary Coding Club, where we teach beginner lessons in programming
            to children from third to fifth grade, while helping to tutor kids in other TSA-related subjects, from
            fashion design to debate to architecture to building 3-D models.</section></td>

              Other Activities
            </section>
            Our club has joined in on many different projects to help improve our community. One of them is the Living Roof
            project, where the goal is to help preserve our environment. This project plans a roof that is at least
            partially covered with shrubs, bushes, and even small trees, all of which are planted over a waterproof surface.
            It can also include other layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems to help keep the
            roof functioning. It would be placed above the school roof, and would provide lots of benefits to the students.</section></td>

        Awards
      </section>
      Our chapter's young age means we do not yet have many awards to our name. However, we have won a variety in the
      past, including such as the 2017 National Coding Title. Of course, this year, we hope to increase our school's
      collection of awards, and have set our sights on success, especially in webmaster. All of our teams are working hard to
      succeed this year, and with the effort everyone are putting into their various projects, they will.

        Our Creed
      </section>
      We believe that our education, especially in technological fields, is  critical for our life and our future. We
      believe there is always a need to improve our attitude, work ethic, skills, and the knowledge we hold. We are
      guided by our teachers, other experts we trust, and our own beliefs; we will strive to do our best in improving
      both our community and the world at large. <br>We accept the responsibilities that is placed upon our shoulders.
      We accept the moral codes that have been developed by others in the past. We will explore for safer, more
      effective methods of working and living. We will develop beneficial attitudes and exercise tact and respect
      for other individuals. Through manual and intellectual work, we will express our ideas to the best of our
      abilities to the society around us. We will make it our goal to be and do better each day, and to be steadfast
      in our belief in ourself, and our fellow Americans.
