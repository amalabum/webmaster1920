              </section>
              We are Chapter 2111, and we currently have about twenty members. Our chapter has been slowly
              growing over the years, and we have members competing in various events this year. We believe
              in working hard and doing our best to achieve our goals, even if some might look down on our efforts,
              because we know that the process of learning is far more valuable than the reward itself. Click here to

                  We believe that our education, especially in technological fields, is  critical for our life and our future. We
                  believe there is always a need to improve our attitude, work ethic, skills, and the knowledge we hold. We are
                  guided by our teachers, other experts we trust, and our own beliefs; we will strive to do our best in improving
                  both our community and the world at large.

                    Our History
                  </section>
                  Mckinney Boyd's Computer Science Club was founded in 2015 by Thai Nguyen and Sammy Shin, who sought to help others learn how to program. The Engineering Club
                  has been a part of student life at Boyd since 2010, and they worked together with
                  both TSA and the Living Roof. Now, the clubs joined to help everyone work
                  on their TSA projects, meet new people they can partner with, and just see other available options
                  they can try next time.</div>

                    </section>
                    We volunteer at Hour of Code events in schools within our community. This is an oppportunity where we provide
                    lessons to those interested in computer science who don't have the resources to get started. We also
                    volunteer in the Eddins Elementary Coding Club, where we teach beginner lessons in programming
                    to children from third to fifth grade, while helping to tutor kids in other TSA-related subjects, from
                    fashion design to debate to architecture to building 3-D models.

                    Our club has joined in on many different projects to help improve our community. One of them is the Living Roof
                    project, where the goal is to help preserve our environment. This project plans a roof that is at least
                    partially covered with shrubs, bushes, and even small trees, all of which are planted over a waterproof surface.
                    It can also include other layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems to help keep the
                    roof functioning. It would be placed above the school roof, and would provide lots of benefits to the students.

                    We have people competiting in many differnt competitions, depending on their perosonal interests. These cometitions
                    include: Architectural Design, Debating Technology Issues, Biotechnology Design, Structural Design, Essays on Technology,
                    Extemporaneous Speech, Software Development, Music Production, Transportation Modeling, and Engineering Design.
                    And, of course, we participate in the coding and webmaster competitions.

                    Our chapter's young age means we do not yet have many awards to our name. However, we have won a variety in the
                    past, including such as the 2017 National Coding Title. Of course, this year, we hope to increase our school's
                    collection of awards, and have set our sights on success, especially in webmaster. All of our teams are working hard to
                    succeed this year, and with the effort everyone are putting into their various projects, they will.
