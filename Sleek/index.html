    Who We Are
  </section>
    While McKinney Boyd High School has just over a decade of history to its name, the impact it has had within
    the community is undeniable. Brought to life by Mary Elizabeth Boyd’s vision, who left a fortune to take care
    of the students she loved, our school has always been driven to rise above its own expectations. From academics
    to athletics, we have it all!
    <br><br>
    Boyd boasts a large population of over 3000 students, a number that is ever-growing, but still manages to
    provide the best quality education for all of them, leaving no student behind. With over 40 classrooms and 10
    laboratories, as well as a well-stocked Learning Commons, our academic base is well-covered. In addition, Boyd’s
    athletic facilities include a baseball field, eight tennis courts, competition and practice gymnasiums, and a
    training room.
    <br><br>
    Not only does our school value the academic prowess of the students, but it also seeks to expand their horizons
    extracurricularly. We have many active clubs and organizations, from the prestigious National Honor Society for
    community service to the informal Pi Club for math-lovers. No matter where your interests lie, you can find your
    calling at Boyd.
